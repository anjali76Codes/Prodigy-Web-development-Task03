How to Play
Select your opponent: "Player" for a two-player game or "AI" to play against the computer.
Click on an empty cell on the game board to make a move.
The game will alternate turns between "X" and "O."
The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the board is full and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
